### What a week
#### We have handled some *errors* :bangbang: with our travelling documents
#### Then we went on a trip :airplane: with our map *map*
#### Had some TBT bout how school :school: was and *classes* (That one teacher)
#### And we got to see some Queens... *8 Queens* :crown:

##### We got to face the facts... It was an awesome time but not the only time
##### In *Code review* :star: we get to have single scripts of the same Implementations
##### But different approach, we can do it together...
##### For now we will use *ChatGPT* :muscle: maybe some other time *Googles Gemini* :muscle:
